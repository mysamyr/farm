game can be played with 2-4 players.
There is 2 dices: blue and orange.
Blue dice has sides: 6 ducks, 3 goats, 2 pigs and 1 horse.
Orange dice has sides: 6 ducks, 3 goats, 2 pigs and 1 cow.
The objective of the game is to collect all 5 animals: duck, goat, pig, horse and cow (at least 1 of each).
Animal cards can be exchanged:

- 6 duck cards for 1 goat card
- 2 goat cards for 1 pig card
- 3 pig cards for 1 horse card
- 2 horse cards for 1 cow card

At the start of the game, each player has 1 duck card.
Players take turn in order, defined at the start of the game.
On a player's turn, it can perform following actions:

- (optional) Exchange animal cards according to the exchange rules above. (a player can exchange multiple times in one
  turn, as long as they have enough cards. But only BEFORE rolling the dice.)
- Throw 2 12-sided dice and collect animal cards based on the pair on animals. Examples:
  - If player has 1 duck card and rolls 1 duck, they get 1 additional duck card (because there is 1 pair).
  - If player has 2 goat cards and rolls 2 goats, they get 2 additional goat cards (because there are 2 pairs).
  - If player has 0 pig cards and rolls 2 pigs, they get 1 pig card (because there is 1 pair, even they haven't had
    any pig cards yet).
  - If player has 0 goats and 0 pigs and rolls 1 goat and 1 pig, they get nothing (because there is no pair).

The first player to collect all 5 animals (at least 1 of each) wins the game.

After throwing the dices, the turn passes to the next player.
